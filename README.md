# Join our product & engineering team!

We‚Äôre a curious, supportive, and high-performing team of professionals that is passionate about creating a culture where every engineer, designer, product manager, and UX researcher gets to make a real impact.

Businesses around the world use [GetApp](https://getapp.com) every day to make the right technology decisions and find the tools they need to grow, optimize, and become more effective at what they do.

If you have a passion for technology and development, a hunger to learn, and a desire to meet challenges, we'd love to get to know you!


GetApp makes up 1/3 of Gartner Digital Markets, with headquarters located in central Barcelona, Spain. 


## How we work:

*   We have a **flexible start each morning** ‚Äî you can come in anytime between 7:30 and 10:30. We update the team on our progress during our **daily meeting** which begins at 10:30. If you‚Äôre working from home that day, don‚Äôt worry, you can easily join us via a high-quality video call. 
*   Twice a week, we **discuss new ideas and topics** that any team member brings to the table, such as, _‚ÄúWe could test using X‚Äù_, or _‚ÄúWhat about changing this naming convention?‚Äù_, or _‚ÄúThis would speed up the deployment process, what do you think?‚Äù_. Each proposal opens a new discussion, which eventually leads to changes that **impact and improve our daily work**. All members vote. **Everyone‚Äôs opinion matters.**
*   We like to keep the number of meetings down to a minimum in order to maximize our time to stay focused. However, we do have biweekly **SCRUM meetings** for **planning** or **retrospective,** as well as bimonthly meetings with the **product team**.
*   **Pair programming** and **Code reviews** allow us to make sure we are all on the same page and our work meets our quality standards. We have a **pretty sane testing culture** too ‚Äî which helps us keep things under control.
*   We don‚Äôt like to schedule meetings after 5 PM, so, depending on the time you came in, you‚Äôll usually get to head home at around 6:30 PM (or earlier ‚Äî if you‚Äôre an early bird!).
*   On Fridays, we have beers at 1 PM (aka **Beer O‚ÄôClock**) with the entire GDM team in Barcelona. From time to time, we‚Äôll have our beers during a **Tech Talk**, if there are any presentations scheduled for that day. We head home around 2 or 3 PM and enjoy an early start to the weekend. 


## Who you‚Äôll work with:

10 software engineers, 2 UX designers, 1 UX writer, 1 product manager, 1 QA, 1 data analyst, 2 creative designers‚Ä¶ And more to come!

## 6-month plan:

**Your first week,** you‚Äôll meet the entire team and get your development environment ready to work autonomously. You‚Äôll be able to begin contributing to the team with small developments that will help you get up to speed, as well as become familiar with the GetApp product.

**Your first month,** you‚Äôll already be working on the development of key features on the website. You‚Äôll be taking part in design discussions, you‚Äôll be a real contributor to the team, as well as join all product-related meetings that bring new ideas and make an impact. 

**In 3 months,** you‚Äôll be a full contributor in terms of development and team initiatives. You‚Äôll propose improvements to the way we work based on your previous experience and the knowledge you bring on board. 

**In 6 months,** you‚Äôll get full autonomy to work on projects ‚Äî from gathering requirements to final product development.
